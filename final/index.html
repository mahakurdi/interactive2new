		<p>Los Angeles–based artist Rodney McMillian’s work addresses how American political and social histories shape issues of class, race, and gender. In his first solo museum presentation on the West Coast, McMillian brings together his long-standing interest in the representation of the American landscape with an exploration of home as a place and a state of mind.</p>
		
		<p>The exhibition features a painted abstract panorama spanning the entirety of the gallery, paired with a soundscape interweaving iconic 1980s songs performed by McMillian and the voice of a social advocate proposing radically new language and policies around the condition of homelessness. This immersive installation questions the political systems that promise freedom and equality for all, and highlights the power of the individual to affect hope and create change.</p>
